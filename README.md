## Profile
I build **end-to-end ML systems** that move from experimentation to reliable production—covering data/experiment management, model development, deployment, and operational feedback loops. My work spans **traditional machine learning**, **computer vision** and **agentic AI** use cases, with an engineering-first approach to reliability, evaluation, and scalability.

## Core Focus Areas
**Agentic AI**
- Designing tool-using agents that connect to real systems (APIs, knowledge bases, internal tools)
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns, grounding, and guardrails
- Evaluation discipline: quality metrics, failure-mode analysis, latency/cost trade-offs

**Machine Learning Systems**
- Reproducible pipelines, experiment tracking, and model lifecycle management
- Deployment-ready packaging (containerization), versioning, and release practices
- Monitoring-oriented thinking: instrumentation, drift/quality signals, iterative improvement

**Computer Vision**
- Building CV workflows end-to-end: data-centric iteration, model selection, evaluation, and deployment
- Practical post-processing and system integration for real-world constraints

---

## Technical Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL, No-SQL, C (currently learning)
**ML/DL:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn  
**MLOps / Engineering:** Docker, Git, Linux, MLflow, DVC  
**GenAI:** LLM applications, agent orchestration patterns, RAG, evaluation/guardrails  
**Analytics:** Power BI  
**Systems (learning):** CUDA programming (currently learning)

## Current Development Goals
- Deepen systems-level proficiency (C + CUDA) to better optimize ML performance paths
- Strengthen agent evaluation and reliability (grounding, tool safety, automated test harnesses)
- Understanding of different agentic frameworks
- Continue building deployment-first ML components usable across cloud and edge environments
- Typescript for web apps development
- More about software in general
